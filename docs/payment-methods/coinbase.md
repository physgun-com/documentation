[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is a crypto trading platform, it allows you to buy/sell/trade your crypto. Cosmo has an integration with it, it allows people to purchase packages from your store with crypto. 

Crypto in general however has a couple downsides: the coins fluctuate in value and a payment can take a while to process.
